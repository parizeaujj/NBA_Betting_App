# Product Vision

BrokeBets is an IOS sports entertainment app that seeks to give its users an engaging, head-to-head, competitive experirence. The app provides a platform for sports ethusisats who have a desire to enter into thrilling sports predition contests without the added worry of losing money (a worry that could be found in some other betting apps and formats). Our app is not only for hardcore sports enthusiasts. BrokeBet's user friendly platform makes it easy for even those new to sports prediction contests to jump in and start with little guidance. 

Although there are other sports betting applications such as FanDuel and PointsBet, BrokeBet's approach to sports betting sets it apart from it's competitors. The principle component of BrokeBet's unique betting system is something that we call the "bet draft." The "bet draft" is a unique system that allows each player partcipating in a particular contest to take turns selecting a particular bet for a particular game. After one player selects a certain bet for a certain game, the bet that they took is added to their betslip and the opposite/inverse of that bet is added to the betslip of their opponent. This oppositional sports betting format adds a unique layer of complexity to sports betting. Not only do you have to decide which position to take, you have to consider the fact that not every position is guarentted to be avaiable to you, and you must strategize accordingly.

Our app offfers a new and challenging betting experience for those looking to compete in thrilling, head-to-head, and engaging compentitions with friends.

# Sprint 1

Each item should link to the actual product, be it a google spreadsheet, google doc, github markdown file, etc. Do not link to a markdown file that contains only a link to another location - link directly from the appropriate item below. Failure to adhere to this criteria wil result in the associated artifact not being graded. Add any additional items required for the specific sprint submission.

## Task Allocation

Todd Weidler - Setup basic SwiftUI Project

JJ Parizeau - Meeting Tasks (meeting notes and other files)

Everyone - Download the example project and learn SwiftUI basics

In this section, each group member needs to provide a brief description of what they worked on during the sprint. Keep this short and to the point. Your trello board and commit history will provide the details. 

**note**: For this first sprint, I am anticipating that you will have selected one or two user stories for the Sprint Backlog, and most likely not have completed them since the majority if this week will consist of getting your product backlog, requirements, and development environment fleshed out and stood up. The only implementation I am expecting to see is that your development environment is properly configured to where it can at least run a basic "hello world" type application.

## Task Allocation

Member 1 - main tasking

Member 2 - main tasking

**note**: For this sprint, I am anticipating that you will continue to work on the stories carried over from Sprint 1, with a focus on the design aspect of your system. I am expecting your architecture document and diagrams to reflect the system only in the context of these user stories, with some generalization to help plan for the other items currently in the backlog. I am not expecting a significant amount of implementation at this point, if any at all.
