# Product Vision

BrokeBets is an iOS entertainment app that provides a platform for people who enjoy competing against their friends at head-to-head sports betting (without money). Unlike FanDuel, which also offers head-to-head betting, our product is unique in its approach in that it incorporates something that we call the “bet draft.” The “bet draft” is a system that allows each player to take turns selecting a particular bet for a particular game. When one player selects a certain bet for a certain game, that bet is added to the player's betslip and the inverse/opposite of that bet is added to their opponent's bet slip. This adds another level of complexity to deciding which bets you should take because now you aren't guaranteed the ability to take the side of a bet that you want and must strategize accordingly. Our app offers a new and challenging betting experience for those who want to compete head to head with friends.

# Sprint 1

Each item should link to the actual product, be it a google spreadsheet, google doc, github markdown file, etc. Do not link to a markdown file that contains only a link to another location - link directly from the appropriate item below. Failure to adhere to this criteria wil result in the associated artifact not being graded. Add any additional items required for the specific sprint submission.

## Task Allocation

Member 1 - main tasking

Member 2 - main tasking

In this section, each group member needs to provide a brief description of what they worked on during the sprint. Keep this short and to the point. Your trello board and commit history will provide the details. 

**note**: For this first sprint, I am anticipating that you will have selected one or two user stories for the Sprint Backlog, and most likely not have completed them since the majority if this week will consist of getting your product backlog, requirements, and development environment fleshed out and stood up. The only implementation I am expecting to see is that your development environment is properly configured to where it can at least run a basic "hello world" type application.
