# Product Vision

BrokeBets is an iOS entertainment app that provides a platform for people who enjoy competing against their friends at head-to-head sports betting (without money). Unlike FanDuel, which also offers head-to-head betting, our product is unique in its approach in that it incorporates something that we call the “bet draft.” The “bet draft” is a system that allows each player to take turns selecting a particular bet for a particular game. When one player selects a certain bet for a certain game, that bet is added to the player's betslip and the inverse/opposite of that bet is added to their opponent's bet slip. This adds another level of complexity to deciding which bets you should take because now you aren't guaranteed the ability to take the side of a bet that you want and must strategize accordingly. Our app offers a new and challenging betting experience for those who want to compete head to head with friends.
