# Product Vision

BrokeBets is a sports entertainment app for iOS that seeks to give its users an engaging, head-to-head, competitive experience. The app provides a platform for sports enthusiasts who have a desire to enter into thrilling sports prediction contests without the added worry of losing money (a worry that could be found in some other betting apps and formats). Our app is not only for hardcore sports enthusiasts. BrokeBet's user-friendly platform makes it easy for even those new to sports prediction contests to jump in and start with little guidance. 

Although there are other sports betting applications such as FanDuel and PointsBet, BrokeBet's approach to sports betting sets it apart from its competitors. The principal component of BrokeBet's unique betting system is something that we call the "bet draft." The "bet draft" is a unique system that allows each player participating in a particular contest to take turns selecting a particular bet for a particular game. After one player selects a certain bet for a certain game, the bet that they took is added to their betslip and the opposite/inverse of that bet is added to the betslip of their opponent. This oppositional sports betting format adds a unique layer of complexity to sports betting. Not only do you have to decide which position to take, but you also have to consider the fact that not every position is guaranteed to be available to you, and you must strategize accordingly.

Our app offers a new and challenging betting experience for those looking to compete in thrilling, head-to-head, and engaging competitions with friends.

# Sprint 1

Each item is linked to the actual product, be it a google spreadsheet, google doc, github markdown file, etc.

- [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/5Ppmtzr9/nbaproject) (Backlogs and Requirements)
- [Burndown Chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pVsd3aALm122RHDQUNY6Yl-JIwwv7_jYz-tVhUx3qMM/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Velocity Chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19NiffaIBn3zLbjg6jmhpLCJWMidPjQ7hmEVjF_mxBWI/edit?usp=sharing)
- System Architecture
- Source Code
- Automated Tests
- Product Demonstration
- [Shared Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gYFik-nxfsuJPQ-2xIo4uRZ2wcKz3Hjy?usp=sharing)

## Task Allocation

Todd Weidler - Setup basic SwiftUI Project

JJ Parizeau - Meeting Tasks (meeting notes and other files)

Everyone - Download the example project and learn SwiftUI basics

In this section, each group member needs to provide a brief description of what they worked on during the sprint. Keep this short and to the point. Your trello board and commit history will provide the details. 

**note**: For this first sprint, I am anticipating that you will have selected one or two user stories for the Sprint Backlog, and most likely not have completed them since the majority if this week will consist of getting your product backlog, requirements, and development environment fleshed out and stood up. The only implementation I am expecting to see is that your development environment is properly configured to where it can at least run a basic "hello world" type application. 


# Sprint 2

## Task Allocation

JJ Parizeau - Setup meetings, organize files and contribute to Trello Board

Todd Weidler - Created tab bars, and basic shell of what the "contests" tab will look like, and contributed to design docs

**note**: For this sprint, I am anticipating that you will continue to work on the stories carried over from Sprint 1, with a focus on the design aspect of your system. I am expecting your architecture document and diagrams to reflect the system only in the context of these user stories, with some generalization to help plan for the other items currently in the backlog. I am not expecting a significant amount of implementation at this point, if any at all.
